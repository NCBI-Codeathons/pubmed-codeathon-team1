        <Abstract>
          <AbstractText Label="BACKGROUND">There is limited evidence concerning the longer term language, literacy and cognitive skills of young adults with developmental language disorder (DLD). Studies that exist suggest continuing difficulties with language and reading, but abilities may change over time.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="AIMS">This study aimed to examine the language, literacy and cognitive skills of young adults with and without DLD.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES">Data were used from the Manchester Language Study data set which was collected from a group of young adults with DLD (recruited originally at 7 years of age from language units-specialist educational resource bases). Participants were assessed on their language, literacy and cognitive functioning when they were aged 24. A comparison group of age-matched peers (AMPs; also 24 years old) were also assessed. For language and cognition, change in scores between 16 and 24 years was also available for analysis. Finally, self-rated measures of literacy difficulties were taken at 24 years for functional reading and writing.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="OUTCOME &amp; RESULTS">The results indicate that the young people with DLD in this sample continue to perform more poorly as a group on formal oral and written language tests. A small but significant minority of young adults with DLD also report functional reading and writing difficulties compared with AMPs despite reporting reading as often as their peer group. Compared with scores at 16 years of age, this subsample now appears to show slightly less risk of non-verbal IQ difficulties, showing small but significant 'catch-up' to AMPs.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSIONS &amp; IMPLICATIONS">These preliminary data suggest that at least some individuals with DLD experience marked linguistic difficulties in adulthood, and that the pathways of language, literacy and cognition are not entirely parallel for this group. Continued support and awareness of challenges for young adults with DLD may be useful. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject It is known that DLD is long term and persists into adulthood. There has recently been a body of work reporting on the well-being of this population, as well as their employment, financial status and driving ability. However, there is very little information about language, literacy and cognitive skills beyond school age. What this paper adds to existing knowledge This study presents data on language, literacy and cognition from a large cohort of young adults with DLD and their AMPs. In this sample, a large proportion of participants score low on language, with fewer scoring as impaired on literacy and cognition. A significant minority reports difficulties in functional reading. Preliminary analysis appears to suggest that while language development remains depressed, non-verbal cognitive skills show some catch up over time. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Increased awareness and continued support for language, literacy and cognition may be useful for young adults with DLD.</AbstractText>
