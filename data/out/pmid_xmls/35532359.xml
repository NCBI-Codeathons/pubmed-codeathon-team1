        <Abstract>
          <AbstractText>Extensively used in several industries in China as a cleaning agent, 1-bromopropane (1-BP) has significant adverse effects on the central nervous system. However, neither its mechanism of action nor sensitive biomarkers related to it have been determined thus far. In this study, animal experiments and occupational surveys were performed to explore the typical exposure and effect biomarkers of neurotoxicity induced by 1-BP. Male Wistar rats were exposed to 0, 500, or 1000 ppm of 1-BP followed by pathological and biomarker analyses. An epidemiological survey was conducted on 71 workers each from 1-BP exposed and control groups. Serum and urine samples were collected for biomarker testing. cNSE represents neuron-specific enolase (NSE) in the cerebral cortex, where as sNSE represents NSE in the serum; similar terminology applies to S-100β, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). In rats exposed to 1000 ppm 1-BP, pathological changes were observed in Purkinje cells, lumbar gray matter, and tibiofibular nerve, while levels of cNSE, cS-100β, cCOX-2, sS-100β, and sCOX-2 were significantly elevated at different time checkpoints. In the 500 ppm group, cCOX-2, sNSE, and sCOX-2 levels were significantly elevated at different time checkpoints. 1-BP and N-acetyl-S-(n-propyl)-L-cysteine (AcPrCys) were detected in rat urine, and there was a correlation between the level of sNSE or sCOX-2 and AcPrCys in the 500 ppm group. In the occupational epidemiological study, a significant correlation between AcPrCys and exposure concentration was also detected. The findings of this study indicated that AcPrCys was a sensitive exposure biomarker of 1-BP in rats as well as occupational populations.</AbstractText>
