          <AbstractText Label="PURPOSE" NlmCategory="OBJECTIVE">To determine whether T2-contrast enhancement techniques can be used to diagnose endolymphatic hydrops, we compared fluid signal artifacts with and without T2-contrast enhancement techniques in 3D fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (3D-FLAIR).</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="METHODS" NlmCategory="METHODS">We prepared a custom-made phantom consisting of eight tubes half-filled with saline. Images were obtained using four 3D-FLAIR: without T2-contrast enhancement (Normal), with non-selective T2-inversion recovery (T2-IR), and two with non-selective T2 preparation IR (T2-prep). Scans were performed with and without rice covering the phantom to simulate minimal and severe B0-inhomogeneity conditions. The average signal intensity (SI) values of eight saline tubes were compared between the four sequences and between each other. Comparisons were performed for all measurement slices and the central 10 slices. The images using T2-contrast enhancement technique were obtained from a volunteer and a patient suspected of Meniere's disease.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="RESULTS" NlmCategory="RESULTS">The Normal sequence SI for all slices was significantly lower than that for the other sequences, with smaller standard deviation (SD) and no outliers. Several outliers were detected in the other sequences. The SDs and outliers were larger without rice than with rice. When the central 10 slices with rice, the T2-IR had a significantly higher SI with more outliers compared with the Normal sequence. The T2-prep had no outliers and SIs that were comparable to those of the Normal sequence. However, without rice, the T2-IR and T2-prep sequences had significantly higher SIs with outliers and larger SDs compared to the Normal sequence. In the corresponding images, the Normal sequence achieved excellent fluid suppression, whereas the T2-IR and T2-prep sequences showed high-signal artifacts. Imperfect fluid suppressions were observed in the volunteer image and the endolymphatic hydrops on the post-gadolinium image differed in size and shape in the non-injected T2-IR in the patient image.</AbstractText>
          <AbstractText Label="CONCLUSION" NlmCategory="CONCLUSIONS">T2-contrast enhancement techniques should be used with caution in 3D-FLAIR for diagnosing endolymphatic hydrops.</AbstractText>
