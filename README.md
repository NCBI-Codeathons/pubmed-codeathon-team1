##What does PubMed JUSTRIEVER do?
The goal of PubMed JUSTRIEVER is to describe any potential biases that exist in search results based on PubMed Best Search Algorithm. The specific focus is on biases based on author and article attributes.

Some of the author attributes we are interested in are gender, race, institutional affiliation, country of origin, and author authority (e.g. research impact based on number of hits).
